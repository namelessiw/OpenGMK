# gm8exe

Library used for reading & writing executables created with GameMaker 8 into data structures.

## Documentation & Usage
The documentation is a best-effort and is not complete, you will probably need to read the source if you want to use this.

Not actually hosted anywhere, build it yourself with `cargo doc`. A good starting point is `reader::from_exe`.
